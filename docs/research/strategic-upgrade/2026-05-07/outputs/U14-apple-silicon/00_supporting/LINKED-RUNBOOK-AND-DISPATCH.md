# LINKED RUNBOOK AND DISPATCH


## Claim label legend

This pack uses explicit claim labels because U14 is a candidate research artifact, not production authority.

- `[prompt-provided]` means the item comes from the uploaded U14 prompt or from the uploaded post176 pack inspected in this session.
- `[post176-evidence]` means the note is derived from the local post176 zip contents; the repeated boundary there says ASR, FFmpeg, browser automation, `audio_transcript`, runtime unlock, and vault true write were not proved or approved.
- `[baseline-knowledge]` means stable general engineering knowledge available before the cutoff, such as Apple Silicon unified memory, Metal, MPS, Core ML, VideoToolbox, FFmpeg, PyTorch MPS, MLX, llama.cpp, Ollama, SQLite, and local media processing concepts.
- `[recipe-spec]` means a recommended configuration, benchmark protocol, fallback ladder, or integration shape that still needs local proof.
- `[requires-local-verification]` means the statement must be checked on the user's Mac with `system_profiler`, `sysctl`, `powermetrics`, package introspection, model hashes, and paste-time benchmark logs.
- `[not-web-verified-2026]` means the named framework, model, version, or vendor status would normally require live browsing. Live web was unavailable here, so no current vendor claim is asserted.
- `[privacy-boundary]` means raw materials stay local by default; cloud API replacement is explicitly not approved by this pack.


## Boundary preservation

`candidate / not-authority` is intentional. This file does not install software, does not load LaunchAgents, does not modify macOS settings, does not run ASR, does not transcode media, does not inspect private model directories, does not approve vault true writes, and does not present benchmark numbers as self-run evidence. Any command is a future local run specification only. A future operator must paste evidence before promotion.


## Linked runbook and dispatch

[prompt-provided] U14 is linked to Phase 2-4 unlock ambitions, U2 ASR/vault performance requirements, U6 visual-DAM and hybrid retrieval ambitions, and PF-V GPT-Image-2 post-processing needs. GitHub search in this session found the ScoutFlow repository but did not find the specific U2/U6 prompt files at the paths listed in U14. Therefore, this runbook records the linkage as prompt-provided and not independently fetched.

## Dispatch lanes

| Lane | Candidate clusters | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| LANE-2 ASR | A, E, F, G, H | research only; no runtime ASR unlock |
| LANE-1 vault write | B, C, F, H | no true write approval; candidate derived artifacts only |
| visual-DAM | B, D, E, G, H | image/video derivatives remain sidecar candidates |
| GPT-Image-2 post-processing | D, G, H | local post-processing only; generation service not approved here |
| Monitoring and resource policy | F, G, H | telemetry specs only; no daemon install |

## Dispatch procedure

1. Classify raw source data and decide whether it is allowed in local candidate processing.
2. Hash and manifest raw files before transformation.
3. Choose the recipe with the smallest viable local path.
4. Run dry mode where available.
5. Capture hardware, package, model, and license evidence.
6. Run the benchmark fixture or small private pilot only after approval.
7. Write derived artifacts to a candidate cache, not the final vault.
8. Attach quality review and fallback evidence.
9. Promote only after a separate implementation decision.

## Escalation rules

[post176-evidence] Because post176 repeatedly preserved blocked runtime boundaries, no U14 recipe can be used to override those redlines. A future unlock must explicitly say which runtime lane is approved, which commands may run, where outputs may be written, and how rollback is performed.


## Extended operating rationale — LINKED RUNBOOK AND DISPATCH

**Rationale 1.** Use a fixed fixture set before scaling. For audio, include silence, music bed, cross talk, compressed platform audio, Chinese-English code switching, and long-form speech. For images, include screenshots, transparent PNG, huge JPEG, duplicate variants, and generated outputs. For video, include H.264, HEVC, variable frame rate, subtitles, and audio-only cases. The purpose is to reveal bottlenecks that matter to ScoutFlow, not to win a synthetic benchmark.

**Rationale 2.** Prefer local evidence over intuition. Apple Silicon performance can change when model size, quantization, context length, display load, package build flags, power source, and thermal state change. A fast demo is not enough. The run log should include command, input hash, model hash, version, power mode, memory pressure, thermal note, wall time, and fallback status.

**Rationale 3.** Keep the operator in control. In a one-person prosumer system, the fastest path is not always the best path. The better path often keeps the Mac responsive, preserves raw evidence, avoids silent mutation, and creates deterministic derived artifacts. A run that finishes earlier but loses timestamps, EXIF, model identity, or cache provenance should be considered a regression.

**Rationale 4.** Separate hot path and cold path. The hot path should use the smallest reliable model or transform for routing, triage, deduplication, or metadata extraction. The cold path can use a larger model only after chunking, VAD, BM25 filtering, pHash clustering, or reranking reduces the input set. This protects unified memory and keeps the UI usable.

**Rationale 5.** Design fallbacks before celebrating the fast path. Every recipe needs a smaller model fallback, a CPU-only or deterministic fallback, a deferred batch mode, and a dry-run metadata mode. Fallbacks are how the system survives missing frameworks, stale package versions, model license constraints, memory pressure, thermal throttling, and battery operation.

**Rationale 6.** Do not overfit to a single metric. Useful ScoutFlow metrics include throughput, quality, timestamp drift, retrieval success, memory peak, cache hit rate, downgrade frequency, queue latency, UI responsiveness, operator review time, and failure recoverability. A slightly slower configuration can be the better production candidate if it is more stable under mixed workloads.

**Rationale 7.** Treat 2026 framework status as a watchlist until verified. The prompt asks for current MLX, Core ML, Metal, MPS, ANE, Foundation Models, Whisper, Parakeet, Voxtral, Ollama, llama.cpp, and FFmpeg status. Live browsing was disabled, so this pack avoids claiming current releases or vendor benchmark results. It provides capture commands instead.

**Rationale 8.** Protect privacy by default. Local inference is preferred because raw ScoutFlow material may include unpublished ideas, private meetings, research prompts, screenshots, and DAM assets. Cloud endpoints may be useful for public experiments, but they are not approved as a replacement for private workflows in this U14 artifact.

**Rationale 9.** Emit boring structured artifacts. Each candidate run should produce JSONL or Markdown with recipe id, source hash, model identity, package version, command id, output schema version, timestamps, metrics, quality flags, and fallback flags. Structured logs make later vault writes, DAM indexing, retrieval debugging, and regression review possible.

**Rationale 10.** Preserve raw evidence. Optimization should never rewrite source audio, video, images, or notes in place. Derived transcripts, thumbnails, embeddings, crops, masks, frames, subtitles, and benchmark logs should live under a candidate cache with hash-linked paths. If a derivative is wrong, the system must be able to rebuild it without guessing settings.

**Rationale 11.** Use staged concurrency. Running ASR, embedding, local LLM inference, thumbnailing, OCR, and video transcode at once can overwhelm unified memory even on strong Apple Silicon hardware. Start with one heavy accelerator job plus one light coordinator, then increase concurrency only when memory pressure, thermals, and UI responsiveness remain stable.

**Rationale 12.** Define downgrade triggers. A recipe should name the signs that move a run from max-horsepower mode to balanced or safe mode: memory pressure yellow/red, swap growth, battery drain, thermal warnings, lower token throughput, repeated hallucination flags, timestamp gaps, or operator jank. Downgrades are a reliability feature, not a failure.

**Rationale 13.** Use a fixed fixture set before scaling. For audio, include silence, music bed, cross talk, compressed platform audio, Chinese-English code switching, and long-form speech. For images, include screenshots, transparent PNG, huge JPEG, duplicate variants, and generated outputs. For video, include H.264, HEVC, variable frame rate, subtitles, and audio-only cases. The purpose is to reveal bottlenecks that matter to ScoutFlow, not to win a synthetic benchmark.
